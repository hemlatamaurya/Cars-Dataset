# How to use the code

# Load the Dataset:
car = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\file.csv"): Loads the dataset from the specified path.

#Initial Data Inspection:
car.head(): Displays the first few rows.
car.shape: Shows the dimensions of the dataset.

# Check for Missing Values:
car.isnull().sum(): Summarizes the count of missing values for each column before filling.


# Fill Missing Values:
Loops through categorical and numerical columns to fill missing values with the mode (most frequent value).


# Filter Data:
car = car[car['Weight'] <= 4000]: Filters out cars with a weight above 4000.


# Transform Data:

car['MPG_City'] = car['MPG_City'].apply(lambda x: x + 3): Increases the MPG_City by 3 for all cars.



# Final Data Inspection:

car.head(2): Displays the first few rows after modifications.
