# Cars-Dataset
The "cars" dataset is a commonly used dataset in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. It contains information about different car models, including various attributes such as miles per gallon (MPG), horsepower, weight, and more. This dataset is often used in educational contexts and for demonstrating techniques in data science because it is relatively simple and easy to understand.

# Common Attributes in the Cars Dataset

MPG (Miles Per Gallon): A measure of fuel efficiency.
Cylinders: Number of cylinders in the engine.
Displacement: Engine displacement.
Horsepower: Power of the engine.
Weight: Weight of the car.
Acceleration: Time taken to accelerate from 0 to a certain speed.
Model Year: Year the car model was released.
